# Pascal Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The triangle is a geometric arrangement of binomial coefficients in a triangular pattern.
Here's how Pascal's Triangle is constructed:
1. Start with the number 1 at the top.
2. Each number below is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
3. Fill in the rows with 1s on the sides.

        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
